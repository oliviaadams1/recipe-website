# Recipe Website Homepage 
>Olivia A.

#### Project Description:

I love to bake and I get most of my recipes from home bakery blogs so when challenged with the task of creating a homepage, I decided to create a mock recipe website page. 
I have included some of my favorite recipes that I am always asked for. This homepage is created with just HTML and CSS and can be run in a web browser after downloading the code
